# small-things
This repo contains some small code examples. There is probably absolutely nothing to learn from here except maybe for necomer programmers. I worked on them on different stages of my programming journey. This repo will serve as sort of an archive for some very little things of mine.

## Small descriptions of the projects:

### [Sliding Window Simulation](https://github.com/j-a-h-i-r/small-things/tree/master/Sliding%20Window%20Simulation)
In data transmission, an algorithm for sending packets (frames) is **Sliding Window** or **Go-Back-N**. This program will simulate a system where a sender is sending frames and a receiver is receiving them.

### [School Personnel Management](https://github.com/j-a-h-i-r/small-things/tree/master/Basic%20School%20Personnel%20List)
This was an assignment for CSE107 (OOP course), that's why it uses OOP things :P. It's fairly straightforward. You can save information about school teacher and students in a text file (not the most efficient, I know) and view/search on them. There is option to add new info too.
